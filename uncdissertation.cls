%---------------------------------------------REVISION HISTORY----------------------------------------------
%
% 2013/11/14: *Completely rewritten from scratch. The new version is configurable by parameters, so 
%              there should not be so much need to edit this class file. See the readme.txt for info.
%
% 2010/07/12: *Make bibliography, list of references, etc., lowercase
%
% 2007/04/02: *Added option for a dedication page.
%             *Changed list of figures.
%
% 2006/01/18: *Changed abstract format to print only Advisor and not also Reader.
%             *Add page number (ii) on copyright page and single space, if it's included.
%
% 2006/03/12: *Added option for electronic submission title page, since this requires no signature lines.  
%              Option is "electronicsig".
%
% 2003/5/1:   *Changed page margins to reflect increased pickyness in the graduate school.
%             *Guaranteed 2'' top margin before all chapters including Title page, abstract, toc, etc.
%             *Changed advisor/reader wording before the abstract for Masters theses.
%
% 1999/3/1:   *Changed some things for List of Tables and List of Figures; in particular, the spacing was 
%              changed and these lists now print either the word table or figure before the reference 
%              number. These changes made by Robert Keller.
%
% 1998/4/14:  *Added page numbers to the copyright page (this is contrary to the sample page in the 
%              dissertation handbook, but is required by the graduate school).
%
% 1998/4/8:   *Changed font size in bibliography to same size as rest of text.
%             *Fixed spacing in list of figures and list of tables.
%             *Set default font size to 12pt, with warning if using 11pt. Also disallowed using 10pt -- use 
%              11pt instead.
%
% 1998/4/5:   *Fixed a bug introduced when fixing the amsbook bug (ugh).
%
% 1998/4/1:   *Fixed a ``bug'' in the amsbook.cls (not recognizing that a new section should be started 
%              when starting a new chapter).
%
% 1998/3/30:  *Changed default font size to 11pt.
%             *Switched chapter numbers in toc back to arabic (approved by graduate school).
%             *Set spacing in toc (allows for long titles).
%             *Added option (datestamp) to print date at top (for drafts only).
%             *Changed spacing in footnotes to single (with a little extra between entries).
%             *Set default footnote symbol to arabic numbers.
%             *Changed some margins (some margins are slightly larger than required by the graduate school).
%
% 1998/3/11:  *Set bibliography spacing (single within entries, double between entries).
%
% 1998/3/3:   *Fixed problem with page numbers on the first page of a chapter (number should't be printed).
%              [set pagestyle to empty]
%
% 1998/2/5:   *Fixed theorem, definition, etc. headings to print in bold face and no indentations proof 
%              heading prints in italics.
%
% 1997/11/16: *Trying to fix spacing in toc -- may have done it with a minimum of fuss.
%             *Fixed list of figures spacing (same trick as for toc).
%             *Adjusted vertical spacing for index head.
%             *Added warnings for missing advisor or readers.
%
% 1997/11/15: *Completed significant changes in the way abstract and preface is handled.
%             *Fixed vertical spacing at chapter heads.
%
% 1997/11/11: *Started fixing vertical spacing problem at chapter heads.
%             *Added option for signature names on one line
%
% 1997/11/10: *Fixed "\DeclareOption{doctoral}{\doctrue}.
%             *Fixed problem with printing appendix number in toc.

%--------------------------------------------------OPTIONS--------------------------------------------------
%This package allows us to process options of the form `key=value' (see http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/kvoptions.pdf).
\RequirePackage{kvoptions}

%change these so that if anyone decides to change the filename in the future, they won't have to change all the variable names.
\SetupKeyvalOptions{
  family=my,
  prefix=my@
}
%Note: \DeclareStringOption[default]{optionname} adds a new option optionname=<whatever>. It creates a new variable \my@optionname that contains the value of the option. It defaults to the value ``default''.
%      \DeclareBoolOption[default]{optionname} adds a new option optionname=true or optionname=false. It defaults to the value ``default''. It creates a new if \ifmy@optionname that may be used to check the value of the option.


%This command nullifys an option, so it doesn't get sent to the base class (report).
\newcommand{\NullOption}[1]{\DeclareVoidOption{#1}{\OptionNotUsed}}




%%% Title page options %%%

%Doctoral or masters thesis?
\DeclareBoolOption[true]{doctoral}  %Defaults to doctoral.
\DeclareComplementaryOption{masters}{doctoral} %Can specify in options either `masters' or `doctoral', or `masters=true', `doctoral=false', etc.

%Do you want to include a copyright page?
\DeclareBoolOption[true]{copyright}




%%% Formatting options %%%

%Should the titles (of the thesis, as well as sections like ``List of Figures'') be in all caps?
\DeclareBoolOption[true]{allcaps}

%Do you want the left (or inside, if using twoside option) margin to be 1in (not wide) or 1.25in (wide)? 
\DeclareBoolOption[false]{wideleftmargin}

%Do you want to print one-sided or two-sided? (Only really matters if you have the one wide margin.)
\DeclareBoolOption[true]{oneside}  %Defaults to one-sided.
\DeclareComplementaryOption{twoside}{oneside}
%We don't actually do anything with this, but report or geometry do.
\ifmy@oneside
  \PassOptionsToClass{oneside}{report}
\else
  \PassOptionsToClass{twoside}{report}
  \PassOptionsToPackage{twoside}{geometry}
\fi

%Do you want to the copyright notice to appear at the top of the page or the bottom?
\DeclareBoolOption[true]{cralignbottom}
\DeclareComplementaryOption{craligntop}{cralignbottom}


%%% Margin options %%%
%The default margins are configured to the requirements of the graduate school as of Nov. 2013. Since it is likely that these requirements will randomly change in the future, you can change the margins via the following options. I assume that the margins will be uniform for the entire document, except for perhaps some extra space at the top and the bottom of certain pages. The terms used are the same as those in the geometry package (see http://www.bakoma-tex.com/doc/latex/geometry/geometry.pdf for details).

%% NOTE: if you need wider margin on the left (inside), use the option wideleftmargin together with setting bindingoffset=<whatever extra space you need on the left>.

%The uniform margin (all sides) for the entire document.
\DeclareStringOption[1in]{margin}

%The left (inner), right (outer), top, and bottom margins separately.
\DeclareStringOption[\my@margin]{left}
\DeclareStringOption[\my@margin]{right}
\DeclareStringOption[\my@margin]{top}
\DeclareStringOption[\my@margin]{bottom}

%How far should the footer (the page number) be from the bottom of the body?
\DeclareStringOption[0.5in]{foot}

%If using wide left margins, how wide should the extra space be?
\DeclareStringOption[0.25in]{bindingoffset}


%%% The following options are used to configure how much ``extra space'' there should be in various spots.

%How much extra space is needed above the titles (in general)?
\DeclareStringOption[0.9in]{extra}

%How much extra space is needed above the main title (on the title page)?
\DeclareStringOption[\my@extra]{titleextra}

%How much extra space is needed above chapter titles (in both front and main matter)?
\DeclareStringOption[\my@extra]{chaptertitleextra}

%How much extra space is needed above chapter titles in the frontmatter (abstract, TOC, etc.)?
\DeclareStringOption[\my@chaptertitleextra]{fronttitleextra}

%How much extra space is needed above the list of figures or tables?
\DeclareStringOption[0in]{listtitleextra}

%How much extra space is needed above chapter titles in the mainmatter (i.e. the main chapters)?
%\DeclareStringOption[\my@chaptertitleextra]{maintitleextra}
\DeclareStringOption[0.89in]{maintitleextra} % for some reason there is just a little extra above main chapter titles.

%How much extra space is needed above appendix titles?
\DeclareStringOption[0in]{appendixtitleextra}

%How much extra space is needed above titles in the backmatter (bibliography, index, etc.)?
\DeclareStringOption[0in]{backtitleextra}

%How much extra space is needed on the bottom (or top) of the copyright page?
\DeclareStringOption[1in]{copyrightextra}






%We want to ignore the following options, to prevent them from getting sent to the base class.
%Paper must be letterpaper:
\NullOption{a4paper}
\NullOption{a5paper}
\NullOption{b5paper}
\NullOption{letterpaper}
\NullOption{legalpaper}
\NullOption{executivepaper}
%Force portrait mode:
\NullOption{landscape}
\NullOption{portrait}
%We will provide our own titlepage.
\NullOption{notitlepage}
\NullOption{titlepage}
%You can have chapters opening on any page (not just the right). --- Never mind, I'll allow this in case you want it in a print version.
%\NullOption{openright}
%\NullOption{openany}
%One column only.
\NullOption{onecolumn}
\NullOption{twocolumn}


%Any option that is not listed above gets sent along to report. This really only leaves the font size (10pt, 11pt, 12pt), leqno, fleqn, and openbib.
\DeclareDefaultOption{\PassOptionsToClass{\CurrentOption}{report}}

%Process the options.
\ProcessKeyvalOptions{my}\relax

%Load the report class, sending any necessary options along.
\LoadClass{report}

%Here we configure some utility functions to provide the extra spaces. (This is necessary to ensure that it works correctly when the extra space is 0pt. It also helps clean up some of the conditionals elsewhere).

NOTE: The \hbox{}\kern-\topskip part should make it start at the actual top of the page (without inserting additional space).

%--------------------------------------------CHAPTER FORMATTING---------------------------------------------


%%% The following commands override those from report to change the display of chapter headers, so that they start 2 inches below the top of the page, and are otherwise formatted appropriately. Hopefully the settings I've provided will allow for a sufficient amount of customization to satisfy the graduate school. If you, you're going to have to wade in to some pretty deep LaTeX stuff here. Additionally we add nonnumbered chapters to the table of contents. %%%

%Now we modify the display of the chapter headings to do the right things.
\def\@makechapterhead#1{%this is for \chapter
  \begin{center}%
  \begin{singlespacing}%
    %Add the appropriate extra space at the beginning.
